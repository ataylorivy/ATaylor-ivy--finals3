Bearded dragons are one of, if not the most popular lizard species; unfortunately because they are so common they often are
abused due to the lack of research people do before buying one. They are a desert species found in australia, 
and require a minimum of a 4 * 2 * 2 feet enclosure, but its highly encouraged to get a bigger one if you can.

<!--Fun Facts: -->
<h2>Fun facts:</h2>
<p>when basking bearded dragons usually expand their body to become more flat do absorb more heat, <br> 
because of this flatness the common name for this is "pancaking"</p>
<p>bearded dragons communicate by head bobbing, waving their hand, and puffing their beards</p>
<p>bearded dragons have a "third eye" called the parietal eye, which helps them track light above their head, <br>
this is because it's useful for seeing birds</p>
